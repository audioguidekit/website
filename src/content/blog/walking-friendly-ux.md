When a visitor is using an audio guide, they aren't sitting at a desk. They are walking. They are looking at buildings, reading street signs, and avoiding other pedestrians.

## The One-Hand Rule

If your interface requires two hands, it's a failure. We designed every core interaction—play, pause, skip, and volume—to be reachable with a single thumb.

### Large Touch Targets

We moved away from standard web buttons to oversized touch areas. This reduces the "fumble factor" when someone is wearing gloves or walking quickly.

- **Primary controls** are at the bottom of the screen.
- **Visual feedback** is high-contrast and glanceable.
- **Haptic feedback** is used where supported to confirm actions without looking at the screen.

## Cognitive Load

An audio guide should be a companion, not a distraction. We stripped away everything that wasn't essential. No social sharing buttons during playback. No "related content" popups. Just the audio and the progress.
