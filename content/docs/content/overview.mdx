Before diving into JSON files, let's talk about what you actually need to create an audio tour. Spoiler: it's probably less than you think.

## The essential ingredients

Every audio tour needs three things:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Audio Files" icon="microphone">
    MP3 or M4A recordings for each stop
  </Card>
  <Card title="Images" icon="image">
    Photos to accompany each stop
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tour data" icon="file-code">
    A JSON file describing your tour
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

That's it. Everything else—themes, multiple languages, offline mode—is optional polish.

## Audio files

Your audio content is the heart of the tour. Here's what works:

### Supported formats

| Format | Extension | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| MP3 | `.mp3` | Universal support, good compression |
| AAC | `.m4a` | Better quality at same file size |
| WAV | `.wav` | Supported but large files |

<Tip>
We recommend **M4A (AAC)** for the best balance of quality and file size. Most podcast hosting services and audio editors support it.

## Tour data (JSON)

The tour data file tells AudioGuideKit about your tour structure. It's a JSON file containing:

- Tour title and description
- List of stops with their content
- Settings like theme and offline mode

### Example structure

```json
{
  "id": "barcelona",
  "language": "en",
  "title": "Barcelona Walking Tour",
  "description": "Discover Gothic Quarter's hidden gems",
  "totalDuration": "45 mins",
  "totalStops": 5,
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-barcelona...",
  "stops": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "audio",
      "title": "Welcome to Barcelona",
      "duration": "3 min audio",
      "image": "https://...",
      "audioFile": "https://..."
    }
  ]
}
```

We'll cover the complete structure in [Creating a Guide](/docs/content/creating-guide).

## File organization

Here's how your content files should be organized:

```
src/data/tour/
├── metadata.json     # Shared settings (theme, offline mode)
├── en.json           # English tour content
├── es.json           # Spanish tour content (optional)
└── de.json           # German tour content (optional)
```

<Warning>
Tour files also need to be copied to `src/data/tour/` for build-time discovery. Both directories must stay in sync. This is a technical requirement of how the app bundles content.
</Warning>
