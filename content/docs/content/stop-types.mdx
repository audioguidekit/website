# Stop types

AudioGuideKit supports 9 different stop types. While most tours primarily use audio stops, mixing in other types can create a richer, more engaging experience.

## Overview

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `audio` | Audio playback with optional transcription | Main tour content |
| `text` | Rich text content | Detailed information |
| `image-text` | Image with accompanying text | Photo essays |
| `video` | Video playback | Demonstrations, intros |
| `3d-object` | Interactive 3D model viewer | Artifacts, architecture |
| `headline` | Large text header | Section dividers |
| `quote` | Styled quotation | Historical quotes |
| `rating` | Star rating collection | Feedback |
| `email` | Email collection form | Newsletter signup |

## Audio stops

The bread and butter of audio tours. Displays a card with image, title, and audio player.

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "type": "audio",
  "title": "Welcome to Barcelona",
  "duration": "3 min audio",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "audioFile": "https://your-storage.com/01-welcome.mp3",
  "transcription": "Welcome to Barcelona! Today we'll explore the Gothic Quarter..."
}
```

### Audio stop fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique stop identifier |
| `type` | Yes | Must be `"audio"` |
| `title` | Yes | Stop title |
| `duration` | Yes | Human-readable duration |
| `image` | Yes | Stop image URL |
| `audioFile` | Yes | Audio file URL (MP3, M4A) |
| `transcription` | No | Text version of the audio |

<Tip>
Include transcriptions! They help with accessibility, allow visitors to read ahead, and improve SEO if search engines crawl your tour.
</Tip>

## Text stops

Display rich text content without audio. Good for detailed information that visitors can read at their own pace.

```json
{
  "id": "2",
  "type": "text",
  "title": "Cathedral History",
  "duration": "2 min read",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "content": "The Barcelona Cathedral was constructed between the 13th and 15th centuries..."
}
```

### Text stop fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `content` | Yes | The text to display |
| Other standard fields | Yes | `id`, `type`, `title`, `duration`, `image` |

## Image-text stops

Combines an image with accompanying text. Like text stops, but with more visual emphasis.

```json
{
  "id": "3",
  "type": "image-text",
  "title": "The Main Altar",
  "duration": "1 min read",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "content": "Notice the intricate gold leaf work on the altar, dating back to..."
}
```

<Note>
Use image-text stops when the image is central to understanding the content. Use text stops when the image is decorative.
</Note>

## Video stops

Embed video content. Useful for introductions, demonstrations, or drone footage.

```json
{
  "id": "4",
  "type": "video",
  "title": "Cathedral Overview",
  "duration": "2 min video",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "videoUrl": "https://your-storage.com/cathedral-overview.mp4"
}
```

### Video stop fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `videoUrl` | Yes | Video file URL (MP4 recommended) |
| Other standard fields | Yes | `id`, `type`, `title`, `duration`, `image` |

<Warning>
Video files are large and may not work well offline. Consider using video stops only for online-only tours or keep videos short.
</Warning>

## 3D object stops

Display interactive 3D models that visitors can rotate and zoom. Great for artifacts, sculptures, or architectural details.

```json
{
  "id": "5",
  "type": "3d-object",
  "title": "Roman Amphora",
  "duration": "Interactive",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "modelUrl": "https://your-storage.com/amphora.glb"
}
```

### 3D object fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `modelUrl` | Yes | 3D model file URL (GLB/GLTF format) |
| Other standard fields | Yes | `id`, `type`, `title`, `duration`, `image` |

<Note>
3D models use the GLB format (binary glTF). You can export from Blender, SketchUp, or download from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com).
</Note>

## Headline stops

Large text headers to divide your tour into sections. Don't include duration—these are visual dividers.

```json
{
  "id": "6",
  "type": "headline",
  "title": "Part 2: The Gothic Quarter",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx"
}
```

### Headline stop fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique stop identifier |
| `type` | Yes | Must be `"headline"` |
| `title` | Yes | The headline text |
| `image` | Yes | Background image |
| `duration` | No | Typically omitted for headlines |

## Quote stops

Display a styled quotation. Perfect for historical quotes, visitor testimonials, or famous sayings about the location.

```json
{
  "id": "7",
  "type": "quote",
  "title": "Antoni Gaudí",
  "duration": "Quote",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "quote": "Nothing is art if it does not come from nature.",
  "attribution": "Antoni Gaudí, 1910"
}
```

### Quote stop fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `quote` | Yes | The quotation text |
| `attribution` | No | Who said it and when |
| Other standard fields | Yes | `id`, `type`, `title`, `image` |

## Rating stops

Collect star ratings from visitors. Appears as an interactive card with 1-5 stars.

```json
{
  "id": "8",
  "type": "rating",
  "title": "How was your tour?",
  "duration": "Rate us",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx"
}
```

<Tip>
Place rating stops near the end of your tour, when visitors have experienced enough to form an opinion.
</Tip>

### Rating collection

When a visitor submits a rating, it's stored locally. If `collectFeedback: true` is set in your metadata, ratings can be collected and analyzed.

## Email stops

Collect email addresses for newsletters or follow-up communication.

```json
{
  "id": "9",
  "type": "email",
  "title": "Stay in Touch",
  "duration": "Sign up",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "description": "Get notified about new tours and special events.",
  "placeholder": "Enter your email"
}
```

### Email stop fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | No | Text explaining why to sign up |
| `placeholder` | No | Input placeholder text |
| Other standard fields | Yes | `id`, `type`, `title`, `image` |

<Warning>
Email collection requires backend integration to actually store emails. The stop type provides the UI, but you'll need to connect it to your email service.
</Warning>

## Mixing stop types

A typical tour might look like this:

```json
"stops": [
  { "type": "audio", "title": "Welcome" },
  { "type": "audio", "title": "First Stop" },
  { "type": "audio", "title": "Second Stop" },
  { "type": "headline", "title": "Part 2: The Old Town" },
  { "type": "audio", "title": "Third Stop" },
  { "type": "quote", "title": "Historical Quote" },
  { "type": "audio", "title": "Fourth Stop" },
  { "type": "rating", "title": "Rate Your Experience" },
  { "type": "email", "title": "Stay Connected" }
]
```

### Best practices

1. **Lead with audio** - Visitors expect audio tours to have audio
2. **Use headlines sparingly** - Too many breaks the flow
3. **Place feedback at the end** - After visitors have context
4. **Keep videos short** - 2 minutes max for mobile attention spans
5. **Test 3D on mobile** - Performance varies by device
