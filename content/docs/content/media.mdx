Your audio files and images need to be accessible via public URLs. This guide covers reliable hosting options for audio guide content.

## Quick recommendations

| Provider | Best For | Free Tier | Pricing |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/r2/) | Most projects (recommended) | 10GB storage, no egress fees | $0.015/GB/month |
| [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage) | Budget production | 10GB storage | $0.006/GB/month |
| [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) | Enterprise scale | Limited | ~$0.023/GB/month |
| [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) | GCP users | $300 credits | ~$0.020/GB/month |
| [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/storage) | Quick prototypes | 1GB storage | $0.021/GB/month |

<Tip>
We recommend **Cloudflare R2** for most audio guides—zero egress fees means you pay only for storage, not downloads. This makes costs predictable regardless of how popular your tour becomes.
</Tip>

## Cloudflare R2 (recommended)

[R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/r2/) is S3-compatible storage with zero egress fees. For audio guides with many visitors, this can save significant costs.

    Sign up at [cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com) and enable R2 in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Bucket">
    Create a new R2 bucket. Enable public access via a custom domain or R2.dev subdomain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Files">
    Use the dashboard, S3-compatible CLI tools, or rclone to upload files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get URLs">
    Files are accessible at:
    ```
    https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev/audio/01-welcome.mp3
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## AWS S3 + CloudFront

For production tours with significant traffic, AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN is the enterprise standard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create S3 Bucket">
    In AWS Console → S3 → Create bucket. Use a region close to your visitors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Enable public access or use CloudFront with signed URLs for access control.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up CloudFront">
    Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to your S3 bucket. This caches files globally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Files">
    Use the AWS CLI or S3 console to upload your audio files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example URL structure

## Backblaze B2

Backblaze B2 is significantly cheaper than S3 with similar reliability. Pair it with Cloudflare for free CDN via their bandwidth alliance.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Account">
    Sign up at [backblaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Bucket">
    Create a new bucket and set it to **Public**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Files">
    Upload your audio and image files via the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get URLs">
    Copy the "Friendly URL" for each file:
    ```
    https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/your-bucket/audio/01-welcome.mp3
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Google Cloud Storage

Similar to AWS S3, with slightly different pricing and a nicer console UI.

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/your-bucket/audio/01-welcome.mp3
```

Google Cloud offers $300 free credits for new accounts—enough to test extensively.

## File organization

Keep your files organized with a consistent structure:

```
tours/
├── london/
│   ├── audio/
│   │   ├── en/
│   │   │   ├── 01-big-ben.mp3
│   │   │   ├── 02-abbey.mp3
│   │   │   └── 03-eye.mp3
│   │   └── es/
│   │       ├── 01-big-ben.mp3
│   │       └── ...
│   └── images/
│       ├── cover.jpg
│       └── ...
└── barcelona/
    └── ...
```

**Naming conventions:**
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Number prefix for ordering (`01-`, `02-`)
- Language subfolder for audio
- Descriptive names (not `audio1.mp3`)

## CORS configuration

If you're hosting on S3 or similar, you may need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow AudioGuideKit to access your files.

### Example S3 CORS policy

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

<Note>
Replace `"*"` in AllowedOrigins with your actual domain in production for better security:
`["https://yourtour.com", "http://localhost:3000"]`
</Note>

## Testing your URLs

Before adding URLs to your tour JSON, verify each one works:

1. Open the URL directly in your browser
2. Audio should play; images should display
3. Check for HTTPS (not HTTP)
4. Test on mobile (some hosts block certain user agents)
