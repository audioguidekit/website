# Media hosting

Your audio files and images need to be accessible via public URLs. This guide covers your options, from free solutions to professional setups.

## Quick recommendations

| Use Case | Recommendation | Cost |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Getting started | Supabase Storage | Free tier generous |
| Production | AWS S3 + CloudFront | ~$0.02/GB/month |
| Images only | Unsplash URLs | Free |
| Podcast-style | Transistor, Buzzsprout | $19+/month |

## Option 1: Supabase storage (recommended for starting)

Supabase offers 1GB free storage with 2GB bandwidth—plenty for a small tour.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Account">
    Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com). Create a new project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Storage Bucket">
    Go to Storage → Create new bucket. Name it `audio` and set it to **Public**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Files">
    Drag and drop your audio files into the bucket.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get URLs">
    Click a file → Copy URL. It will look like:
    ```
    https://xxxxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio/01-welcome.mp3
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Enable the Supabase CDN for faster global delivery. It's in Settings → Storage.
</Tip>

### Supabase pros & cons

**Pros:**
- Generous free tier
- Simple UI for uploading
- Built-in CDN option
- No credit card required

**Cons:**
- 1GB limit on free tier
- Bandwidth limits (2GB/month free)
- Need to upgrade for larger tours

## Option 2: AWS S3 + CloudFront (production)

For production tours with significant traffic, AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN is the gold standard.

### Setup overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create S3 Bucket">
    In AWS Console → S3 → Create bucket. Use a region close to your visitors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Enable public access or use CloudFront with signed URLs for access control.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up CloudFront">
    Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to your S3 bucket. This caches files globally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Files">
    Use the AWS CLI or S3 console to upload your audio files.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example S3 URL structure

```
https://d1234567890.cloudfront.net/tours/london/audio/01-welcome.mp3
```

### Cost estimate

For a tour with 10 audio files (50MB each) serving 1,000 visitors/month:
- Storage: ~$0.01/month
- Transfer: ~$4/month
- Total: ~$5/month

<Note>
AWS pricing is complex but usually cheaper than alternatives at scale. Use the [AWS Calculator](https://calculator.aws/) for accurate estimates.
</Note>

## Option 3: Backblaze B2 (budget production)

Backblaze B2 is significantly cheaper than S3 with similar reliability.

| Metric | AWS S3 | Backblaze B2 |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Storage | $0.023/GB | $0.006/GB |
| Download | $0.09/GB | $0.01/GB |

### Setup

1. Create account at [backblaze.com](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html)
2. Create a bucket (set to Public)
3. Upload files
4. Copy the "Friendly URL" for each file

<Tip>
Pair Backblaze B2 with Cloudflare for free CDN. Cloudflare has a bandwidth alliance with Backblaze that eliminates egress fees.
</Tip>

## Option 4: Google cloud storage

Similar to AWS S3, with slightly different pricing and a nicer console UI.

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/your-bucket/audio/01-welcome.mp3
```

Google Cloud offers $300 free credits for new accounts—enough to test extensively.

## Option 5: Podcast hosting services

If you're already using a podcast host, you might be able to use it for tour audio too.

**Services that work:**
- Transistor
- Buzzsprout
- Anchor (now Spotify for Podcasters)
- Podbean

**Pros:**
- Already paying for it
- Usually includes analytics
- Reliable CDN delivery

**Cons:**
- Not designed for this use case
- May have terms of service issues
- Usually more expensive than cloud storage

## Images: Use Unsplash directly

For images, you don't need to host anything. Unsplash allows direct hotlinking with parameters:

```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513635269975-59663e0ac1ad?w=800&auto=format&fit=crop
```

### Unsplash URL parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `w` | Width in pixels | `w=800` |
| `h` | Height in pixels | `h=600` |
| `auto=format` | Auto WebP delivery | Always include |
| `fit=crop` | Crop to fit dimensions | Optional |
| `q` | Quality (1-100) | `q=80` |

### Finding the right image

1. Go to [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)
2. Search for your location (e.g., "Big Ben London")
3. Click an image → right-click → "Copy image address"
4. Add parameters: `?w=800&auto=format`

<Warning>
Don't use `w=2000` for every image. Card images only need ~800px. Larger sizes waste bandwidth and slow down the tour.
</Warning>

## File naming best practices

Keep your files organized:

```
tours/
├── london/
│   ├── audio/
│   │   ├── en/
│   │   │   ├── 01-big-ben.mp3
│   │   │   ├── 02-abbey.mp3
│   │   │   └── 03-eye.mp3
│   │   └── es/
│   │       ├── 01-big-ben.mp3
│   │       └── ...
│   └── images/
│       ├── cover.jpg
│       └── ...
└── barcelona/
    └── ...
```

**Naming conventions:**
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Number prefix for ordering (`01-`, `02-`)
- Language subfolder for audio
- Descriptive names (not `audio1.mp3`)

## Audio file optimization

Before uploading, optimize your audio files:

### Recommended settings

| Setting | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| Format | M4A (AAC) or MP3 |
| Bitrate | 128 kbps (speech) |
| Sample rate | 44.1 kHz |
| Channels | Mono (for speech) |

### Why these settings?

- **128 kbps**: Perfect for speech; higher bitrates don't improve voice quality
- **Mono**: Human voice doesn't benefit from stereo; saves 50% file size
- **M4A**: Better compression than MP3 at same quality

### Quick optimization with FFmpeg

```bash
# Convert to optimized M4A
ffmpeg -i input.wav -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ac 1 output.m4a

# Batch convert all WAV files
for f in *.wav; do
  ffmpeg -i "$f" -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ac 1 "${f%.wav}.m4a"
done
```

## CORS configuration

If you're hosting on S3 or similar, you may need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow AudioGuideKit to access your files.

### Example S3 CORS policy

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

<Note>
Replace `"*"` in AllowedOrigins with your actual domain in production for better security:
`["https://yourtour.com", "http://localhost:3000"]`
</Note>

## Testing your URLs

Before adding to your tour JSON, verify each URL works:

1. Open the URL directly in your browser
2. Audio should play; images should display
3. Check for HTTPS (not HTTP)
4. Test on mobile (some hosts block certain user agents)
