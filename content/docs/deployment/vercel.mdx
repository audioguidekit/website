# Deploy to Vercel

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy AudioGuideKit. It's free for personal projects, automatically builds on push, and provides a global CDN.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Your AudioGuideKit project pushed to GitHub
- Your tour content ready

## Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (recommended)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

If your project isn't on GitHub yet:

```bash
# Initialize git if needed
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-tour.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up / Log in">
    Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Project">
    Click "Add New..." → "Project" → "Import Git Repository"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repository">
    Find your repository in the list and click "Import"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Project">
    Vercel auto-detects Vite. Leave settings as default:
    - Framework Preset: Vite
    - Build Command: `npm run build` (or leave default)
    - Output Directory: `dist`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click "Deploy" and wait ~60 seconds
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Access your site

After deployment, you'll get a URL like:

```
https://your-tour-abc123.vercel.app
```

Your tour is now live!

## Method 2: Deploy from CLI

For quick one-off deploys without GitHub:

### Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Login and deploy

```bash
# Build your project first
bun run build

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - set up and deploy? yes
# - which scope? your account
# - link to existing project? no (first time)
# - what's your project name? your-tour
# - which directory is your code in? ./dist
```

<Note>
CLI deploys are great for testing, but connecting to GitHub gives you automatic deploys on every push.
</Note>

## Setting up a custom domain

### Step 1: Add domain in Vercel

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Settings → Domains
3. Enter your domain: `tour.your-museum.org`
4. Click Add

### Step 2: Configure DNS

Vercel will show DNS records to add. For a subdomain (`tour.your-museum.org`):

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CNAME | tour | cname.vercel-dns.com |

For a root domain (`your-museum.org`):

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| A | @ | 76.76.21.21 |

### Step 3: Wait for propagation

DNS changes take anywhere from 5 minutes to 48 hours. Usually it's fast. Vercel will show a green checkmark when verified.

### Step 4: SSL certificate

Vercel automatically provisions a free SSL certificate. Your site will be accessible via HTTPS.

## Environment variables

If your tour uses environment variables:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Project Settings">
    Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Variables">
    Add each variable:
    - Name: `VITE_STORAGE_ORIGIN`
    - Value: `https://your-supabase-project.supabase.co`
    - Environments: Production, Preview, Development
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redeploy">
    Go to Deployments → click the three dots → Redeploy
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Environment variables starting with `VITE_` are embedded in the client bundle and visible to anyone. Never put secrets in `VITE_` variables.
</Warning>

## Preview deployments

One of Vercel's best features: every push to a branch creates a preview deployment.

- Push to `feature/new-stops` branch
- Get a preview URL like `your-tour-git-feature-new-stops.vercel.app`
- Test before merging to main
- Merging to main automatically deploys to production

## Automatic builds

With GitHub connected, Vercel:

1. Watches for pushes to your repository
2. Automatically builds on every push
3. Deploys production on pushes to `main`
4. Creates preview deployments for other branches

No manual intervention required after initial setup.

## Build settings

If you need to customize the build:

1. Project Settings → General
2. Scroll to Build & Development Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Framework Preset | Vite |
| Build Command | `npm run build` |
| Output Directory | `dist` |
| Install Command | `npm install` |

For Bun:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Install Command | `bun install` |
| Build Command | `bun run build` |

## Troubleshooting Vercel deployments

### Build fails

Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard. Common issues:

- **Missing dependencies**: Check `package.json`
- **TypeScript errors**: Fix in your code
- **Environment variables**: Make sure they're set

### Site shows old content

- Clear Vercel's cache: Deployments → Redeploy (with "Clear Cache" checked)
- Hard refresh in browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### Custom domain not working

- DNS propagation can take time
- Check DNS records are correct
- Try `dig tour.your-domain.com` to verify

### PWA not working

Service Worker requires HTTPS. If testing locally with Vercel preview, it should work. Check browser DevTools → Application → Service Workers.

## Costs

Vercel's free tier includes:

- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 6,000 build minutes/month
- Unlimited sites
- Custom domains
- SSL certificates

This is plenty for most audio tours. You'd need significant traffic to exceed limits.
