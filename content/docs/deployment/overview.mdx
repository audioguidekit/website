AudioGuideKit builds to a static site—no server required. Deploy to any platform that serves files over HTTPS.

## Build for production

```bash
bun run build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with your complete app: HTML, JS, CSS, tour data, and Service Worker.

## Hosting options

| Platform | Cost | Difficulty | Best For |
|----------|------|------------|----------|
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com) | Free (100GB/mo) | Easy | Most users |
| [Netlify](https://netlify.com) | Free (100GB/mo) | Easy | Alternative to Vercel |
| [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) | Free (unlimited) | Easy | High traffic |
| [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) | Free (unlimited) | Medium | Open source projects |
| [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) | Free (10GB/mo) | Medium | Firebase users |
| [AWS S3 + CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) | ~$1-5/mo | Hard | Full control |
| [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform) | $0-5/mo | Easy | Predictable pricing |

<Tip>
Vercel or Netlify's free tier is sufficient for most tours. You'd need thousands of daily visitors before exceeding limits.

## Custom domains

Options:
- **Platform subdomain** (free): `your-tour.vercel.app`
- **Custom domain**: `tour.your-museum.org` (~$10-15/year or free if you already have it)

Each platform provides DNS setup instructions in their dashboard.
