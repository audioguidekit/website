# Deployment

AudioGuideKit is a static site—no server required. This means you can deploy to virtually any hosting platform for free or very low cost.

## What gets deployed

When you build AudioGuideKit, it produces:

```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── assets/            # JS, CSS bundles
│   ├── index-xxx.js
│   └── index-xxx.css
├── data/              # Your tour JSON files
│   └── tour/
│       ├── metadata.json
│       ├── en.json
│       └── ...
├── sw.js              # Service Worker
├── manifest.webmanifest  # PWA manifest
└── ...
```

This is a self-contained static site. Upload it anywhere that serves files over HTTPS.

## Building for production

Before deploying, create a production build:

```bash
bun run build
```

This:
1. Bundles and minifies JavaScript
2. Optimizes CSS
3. Copies assets to `dist/`
4. Generates Service Worker

The output is in the `dist/` folder.

## Hosting options

### Free platforms

| Platform | Setup Difficulty | Custom Domain | HTTPS |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| Vercel | Easy | Yes (free) | Yes |
| Netlify | Easy | Yes (free) | Yes |
| GitHub Pages | Medium | Yes (free) | Yes |
| Cloudflare Pages | Easy | Yes (free) | Yes |

### Paid platforms

| Platform | Cost | Benefits |
|----------|------|----------|
| AWS S3 + CloudFront | ~$1-5/month | Full control, scalability |
| DigitalOcean App Platform | $5/month | Simple, predictable |
| Traditional hosting | Varies | Use existing infrastructure |

<Tip>
For most tours, Vercel or Netlify's free tier is more than sufficient. You'd need thousands of daily visitors before needing to pay.

## Recommended: Vercel

We recommend Vercel for most users because:

- **Zero configuration** - Detects Vite projects automatically
- **Instant deploys** - Push to GitHub, deploy in seconds
- **Free SSL** - HTTPS with custom domains
- **Global CDN** - Fast everywhere
- **Preview deployments** - Test changes before going live

See [Deploy to Vercel](/docs/deployment/vercel) for step-by-step instructions.

## Domain setup

You can use:

1. **Platform subdomain** (free): `your-tour.vercel.app`
2. **Custom domain**: `tour.your-museum.org`

Custom domains typically require:
- Purchasing a domain (~$10-15/year)
- Configuring DNS records
- Waiting for propagation (minutes to hours)

Most platforms provide guides for their specific setup.

## Environment variables

If you're using features that require environment variables (like a storage origin for media caching), configure them in your hosting platform:

```bash
VITE_STORAGE_ORIGIN=https://your-supabase-project.supabase.co
```

Each platform has its own way of setting environment variables:
- **Vercel**: Project Settings → Environment Variables
- **Netlify**: Site settings → Environment variables
- **GitHub Pages**: Repository secrets (for Actions)

## Pre-deployment checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] Tour content is complete and tested
- [ ] All audio URLs work (test each one)
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] Language switching works (if applicable)
- [ ] Offline download works (if applicable)
- [ ] Theme looks correct
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Build completes without errors (`bun run build`)

## Post-deployment checklist

After deploying:

- [ ] Visit the live URL and test
- [ ] Test on a mobile device (not just desktop)
- [ ] Test offline mode (download, then airplane mode)
- [ ] Check HTTPS is working (lock icon in browser)
- [ ] Verify custom domain (if applicable)

## Updating your tour

After initial deployment, updates are easy:

1. Make changes locally
2. Test with `bun run dev`
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Automatic deploy happens (if using Vercel/Netlify with GitHub)

Or for manual platforms:

1. Run `bun run build`
2. Upload the new `dist/` folder
