This guide will have you running AudioGuideKit locally in about 5 minutes. We'll install the prerequisites, clone the repository, and start the development server.

## Prerequisites

### Install Bun (recommended)

Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime that makes development snappy. It's what we use internally.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS / Linux">
    Open Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
    Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc` on Mac).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
    ```powershell
    powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
    Then restart PowerShell.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Using Node.js instead?">
If you prefer Node.js, you can use that instead. Install Node.js 18 or later from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then replace `bun` with `npm` in all commands below.

For example: `bun install` becomes `npm install`, and `bun run dev` becomes `npm run dev`.
</Accordion>

### Install git

Git is needed to clone the repository.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Git comes pre-installed on macOS. Open Terminal and type `git --version` to verify.

    If not installed, you'll be prompted to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

    Use the default settings during installation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt install git

    # Fedora
    sudo dnf install git
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Clone the repository

Open your terminal, navigate to where you want the project, and clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/audioguidekit/player.git
cd player
```

This creates a `player` folder with all the AudioGuideKit source code.

## Install dependencies

From inside the `player` folder, install the required packages:

```bash
bun install
```

This downloads all the libraries AudioGuideKit needs. It typically takes 30-60 seconds.

<Note>
If you see warnings about optional dependencies or peer dependencies, that's normal and can be safely ignored.
</Note>

## Verify installation

Make sure everything is set up correctly by starting the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

You should see output like:

```
  VITE v6.x.x  ready in 500 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see the demo tour!

## What you just installed

Your project now contains:

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/data/tour/` | Where your tour JSON files go |
| `src/` | Application source code |
| `components/` | React components |
| `hooks/` | Custom React hooks |
| `docs/` | Additional documentation |
