</Card>

## Learning path suggestion

If you're creating your first tour, we recommend this order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Content">
    Read [Content Overview](/docs/content/overview) and [Creating a Guide](/docs/content/creating-guide)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Your Tour">
    Replace the demo tour with your own content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Locally">
    Run `bun run dev` and verify everything works
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Theme">
    Optionally adjust colors and fonts in [Themes](/docs/themes/overview)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Follow [Vercel Deployment](/docs/deployment/vercel) to go live
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Languages">
    Later, add more languages as needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You don't need to learn everything at once. Start simple—a single-language tour with the default theme—and add complexity as you need it.
</Note>
