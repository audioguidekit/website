# Exploring the demo tour

With the development server running (`bun run dev`), let's take a tour of the tour player. This will help you understand what visitors will experience and how the different features work.

## The start screen

When you first open http://localhost:3000, you'll see the tour start screen:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tour Header">
    Shows the tour title, duration, and number of stops. This information comes from your tour JSON file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tour Image">
    A hero image that sets the mood for the tour. This is the `image` field in your tour file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    A brief overview of what visitors will experience. Keep this engaging—it's your pitch!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Button">
    Tapping this begins the tour and loads the first stop.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Notice the language selector in the header? If you have multiple language files, visitors can switch languages here. Try it!
</Tip>

## The tour feed

After starting the tour, you'll see a scrollable feed of "stops." Each stop is a card that can contain:

- **Audio content** with playback controls
- **Images** with optional duration badges
- **Text** for written content
- **Videos** for multimedia stops
- **And more** (quotes, ratings, 3D objects...)

### Try playing audio

Tap on an audio stop card. Notice:

1. **The Mini Player appears** at the bottom of the screen
2. **Lock screen controls work** (try locking your phone while playing)
3. **Progress is saved** automatically—close the browser and reopen to resume

## The mini player

The mini player is the floating control bar at the bottom. It has two states:

### Expanded state

When you tap the player, it expands to show:
- **Track title and progress bar**
- **Play/pause button** (center)
- **Skip forward/backward buttons** (15 seconds)
- **Transcription toggle** (if transcripts are available)

### Minimized state

When you scroll or tap elsewhere, the player collapses to a compact bar. Audio keeps playing!

<Note>
The mini player uses spring physics for smooth animations. This is built with Framer Motion and feels native on mobile devices.
</Note>

## Progress tracking

AudioGuideKit automatically tracks visitor progress:

- **Completed stops** show a checkmark
- **Current position** is saved (even the exact second within an audio track)
- **Progress persists** across page refreshes and browser sessions

Try this experiment:
1. Start playing audio
2. Close the browser tab
3. Reopen http://localhost:3000
4. Your progress should be exactly where you left it!

## Offline mode

If the tour has offline mode enabled, you'll see a "Download for Offline" button on the start screen.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Optional Mode">
    Visitors can choose to download. Great for most use cases.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Offline Only Mode">
    Download is required before playback. Use for locations with no connectivity.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Online Only Mode">
    No download option. For tours with frequently updated content.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Language switching

If your tour has multiple languages, visitors can switch anytime:

1. Tap the **language flag** in the header
2. Select a new language from the sheet
3. Tour reloads in the new language
4. **Progress is preserved**—same stop, same position!

This is one of AudioGuideKit's killer features. Many audio tour apps lose your place when switching languages. We don't.

## Responsive design

Try resizing your browser window or opening on different devices. AudioGuideKit is mobile-first but works beautifully on tablets and desktops too.

The layout adapts with:
- **Mobile**: Full-screen cards, bottom mini player
- **Tablet**: Slightly larger cards, more breathing room
- **Desktop**: Centered content with max-width constraint

## Quick commands reference

While developing, you'll use these commands:

```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build locally
