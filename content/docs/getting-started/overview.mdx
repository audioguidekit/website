# Before you begin

AudioGuideKit is designed to be approachable for non-developers while remaining flexible enough for technical users who want to customize everything. Here's what you need to know.

## What AudioGuideKit is

AudioGuideKit is a **ready-made audio tour player** that you host yourself. It's a web application built with React that visitors access through their phone's browser—no app store download required.

You provide the content (audio files, images, text), and AudioGuideKit handles:
- Audio playback with lock screen controls
- Offline downloads for poor-connectivity areas
- Multi-language support with automatic detection
- Progress tracking so visitors can pause and resume
- A polished mobile-first interface

## What you'll need

### Required

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audio content">
    MP3 or M4A audio files for your tour stops. These need to be hosted somewhere accessible via URL (we'll cover options in the [Media](/docs/content/media) section).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Images">
    Photos for each tour stop. You can use free sources like Unsplash, or host your own.
  </Step>
  <Step title="A computer">
    Mac, Windows, or Linux—anything that can run Node.js.
  </Step>
  <Step title="A place to host">
    A static hosting service like Vercel (free), Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Nice to have

- **Basic command line familiarity** - You'll run a few terminal commands, but we'll walk you through each one
- **A code editor** - VS Code is free and works great, but any text editor will do
- **Audio recording equipment** - Or just your phone! Modern smartphones record surprisingly good audio

## Technical requirements

AudioGuideKit uses:
- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun** (recommended) for running the development server
- **Git** for cloning the repository

<Note>
Don't have these installed? No problem. The [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide walks through setting everything up.
</Note>

## How tours are structured

Every AudioGuideKit tour consists of:

1. **A metadata file** (`metadata.json`) containing settings like the theme and offline mode
2. **Language files** (like `en.json`, `es.json`) containing the actual tour content

Here's a simplified view:

```
src/data/tour/
├── metadata.json     # Settings (theme, offline mode)
├── en.json           # English tour content
├── de.json           # German tour content (optional)
└── fr.json           # French tour content (optional)
```

Each language file contains the tour title, description, and an array of "stops"—each stop being an audio segment with its title, image, and audio file URL.

<Tip>
You can start with just one language file. Add more languages later when you're ready.
