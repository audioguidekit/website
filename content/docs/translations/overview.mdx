---

AudioGuideKit has first-class support for multiple languages. Visitors can switch languages mid-tour without losing their place—something many audio tour apps get wrong.

## How it works

The language system has two parts:

1. **Tour content** - Your translated tour JSON files (`en.json`, `es.json`, etc.)
2. **UI translations** - Button labels, messages, and interface text

Both work automatically based on which language files you provide.

## The visitor experience

When someone opens your tour:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auto-detection">
    AudioGuideKit detects the visitor's device language. Spanish phone? They see the Spanish tour (if available).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fallback">
    If their language isn't available, they get the default language (configurable in `metadata.json`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual switch">
    Visitors can tap the language flag to switch anytime.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Progress preserved">
    When switching, their exact position is saved. Same stop, same timestamp, new language.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The language flag only appears if you have multiple language files. Single-language tours don't show it.

## What gets translated

| Content | Source | Automatic? |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Tour title, description | Your `{lang}.json` file | You provide it |
| Stop titles, content | Your `{lang}.json` file | You provide it |
| Button labels ("Start tour") | Built-in UI translations | Automatic |
| System messages | Built-in UI translations | Automatic |

## Supported languages

AudioGuideKit includes UI translations for:

| Code | Language | UI Included |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `en` | English | Yes |
| `cs` | Czech | Yes |
| `de` | German | Yes |
| `fr` | French | Yes |
| `it` | Italian | Yes |
| `es` | Spanish | Yes |

<Note>
You can add tour content in any language—even ones without UI translations. The interface will fall back to the default language while your tour content displays in the visitor's language. Need another language included out of the box? [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AudioGuideKit/player/issues) and we'll add it.
</Note>

## Language detection logic

Here's how AudioGuideKit picks a language:

```
1. Check localStorage for saved preference
   ↓ (if none found)
2. Detect browser/device language
   ↓ (if not available in tour)
3. Use defaultLanguage from metadata.json
   ↓ (if not set)
4. Use first available language
```

### Preference persistence

Once a visitor manually selects a language, that choice is remembered. Even if they close the browser and return later, they'll see their preferred language.

## Setting default language

Configure the fallback language in `metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "barcelona",
  "defaultLanguage": "en"
}
```

This is used when:
- Visitor's device language isn't available
- No preference has been saved
- The detected language code doesn't match any tour file

## Progress preservation

When visitors switch languages, AudioGuideKit:

1. **Stops audio** (smoothly, not abruptly)
2. **Saves position** (stop ID + timestamp within audio)
3. **Reloads tour** in new language
4. **Restores position** (same stop, paused at same timestamp)
5. **Visitor presses play** to continue in new language

This works because stop IDs are consistent across languages. English stop `"3"` corresponds to Spanish stop `"3"`.

<Warning>
If you use different stop IDs across languages, position restoration will break. Always keep stop IDs consistent!
</Warning>

## Quick setup

To enable multiple languages:

1. Create language files with the same `id` but different `language` values
2. Ensure stop IDs match across all files
3. (Optionally) Set `defaultLanguage` in `metadata.json`

That's it. AudioGuideKit handles detection, switching, and persistence automatically.
