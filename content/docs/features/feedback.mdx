# Feedback collection

AudioGuideKit includes built-in features to collect visitor feedback: star ratings and email signup. These help you understand your audience and build a community.

## Enabling feedback

Enable the rating button in `metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "barcelona",
  "collectFeedback": true
}
```

When `true`, a rating button appears in the header. Visitors can tap it anytime to submit a star rating.

## Star ratings

### How it works

1. Visitor taps the rating button (star icon in header)
2. Bottom sheet slides up with 1-5 star selection
3. Visitor selects a rating and taps Submit
4. Rating is stored locally and can be sent to your backend

### Adding a rating stop

For a more prominent feedback request, add a rating stop at the end of your tour:

```json
{
  "id": "8",
  "type": "rating",
  "title": "How was your tour?",
  "duration": "Rate us",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx"
}
```

This creates a card in the tour feed that encourages feedback.

<Tip>
Place rating requests near the end of the tour, after visitors have experienced enough to form an opinion. Don't ask too early.
</Tip>

## Email collection

Collect email addresses for newsletters or follow-up communication.

### Adding an email stop

```json
{
  "id": "9",
  "type": "email",
  "title": "Stay in Touch",
  "duration": "Sign up",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx",
  "description": "Get notified about new tours and special events.",
  "placeholder": "Enter your email"
}
```

### What visitors see

- Card with your title, description, and image
- Email input field with your placeholder text
- Submit button
- Success message after submission

## Connecting to your backend

Out of the box, feedback is stored locally. To actually collect and analyze it, you'll need to:

1. Set up a backend endpoint to receive data
2. Modify the app to POST feedback to your endpoint

### Example: Sending to a webhook

In a production setup, you'd modify the rating/email handlers to send data:

```typescript
// Example - you'd add this to your fork
async function submitRating(rating: number) {
  await fetch('https://your-api.com/feedback', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      tourId: 'barcelona',
      rating,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    }),
  });
}
```

### Backend options

| Service | Complexity | Cost |
|---------|------------|------|
| Zapier Webhook | Easy | Free tier available |
| Supabase | Medium | Free tier available |
| Custom API | Harder | Varies |
| Google Sheets | Easy | Free |

<Note>
Backend integration requires code changes. This is an area where AudioGuideKit provides the UI, but you customize the data flow.
</Note>

## Analytics considerations

With feedback collection, consider:

### Privacy

- Inform visitors you're collecting data
- Add a privacy policy link if collecting emails
- Consider GDPR compliance for EU visitors

### Storage

- Decide how long to keep feedback
- Anonymize or delete on request
- Secure any PII (personally identifiable information)

### What to track

| Data Point | Usefulness | Privacy Impact |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Star rating | High | Low |
| Email address | High | High |
| Tour ID | High | Low |
| Timestamp | Medium | Low |
| Device type | Medium | Low |
| Location | Low | High |

## Rating best practices

### When to ask

- **Do:** After completing at least half the tour
- **Don't:** On the first stop
- **Do:** As an optional stop near the end
- **Don't:** Force rating before continuing

### How to frame it

Good:
- "How was your tour?"
- "Help us improve"
- "Share your experience"

Avoid:
- "Rate us 5 stars!"
- "Don't forget to rate!"
- Anything that feels pushy

## Email best practices

### Provide value

Tell visitors what they get for signing up:
- "Get notified about new tours"
- "Receive exclusive discounts"
- "Join our community"

### Make it optional

Email collection should never block tour progress. It's a gentle ask, not a gate.

### Follow up

If you collect emails, actually send valuable content:
- New tour announcements
- Behind-the-scenes stories
- Related travel tips

<Warning>
Collecting emails and not using them is worse than not collecting at all. It erodes trust and wastes visitor goodwill.
</Warning>

## Future enhancements

Potential improvements to the feedback system:

- Written review submission
- Photo upload from visitors
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) questions
- Multi-question surveys
- Real-time feedback dashboard

These would require custom development but are possible with AudioGuideKit as a foundation.
