Deep links let you send visitors straight to specific content in AudioGuideKit. Use them on signage, printed brochures, or QR codes.

## URL structure

| Link to | URL Pattern | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Tour overview | `/tour/{tourId}` | `yoursite.com/tour/barcelona` |
| Specific stop | `/tour/{tourId}/{stopId}` | `yoursite.com/tour/barcelona/3` |
| Pre-selected language | `/tour/{tourId}?lang={code}` | `yoursite.com/tour/barcelona?lang=de` |

The `tourId` matches the `id` field in your `metadata.json`. The `stopId` is the numeric ID from each stop in your tour JSON (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).

## Linking to tours

```
https://yoursite.com/tour/barcelona
```

This shows the tour overview with title, description, cover image, and "Start tour" button.

## Linking to stops

```
https://yoursite.com/tour/barcelona/8
```

When visitors open a stop link:
1. The tour loads (if not already cached)
2. Navigation jumps to the specified stop
3. Audio begins automatically (browser permitting)

<Warning>
Mobile browsers may block autoplay until the user interacts with the page.
</Warning>

## Pre-selecting language

Use the `?lang=` parameter to set the tour language via URL:

```
https://yoursite.com/tour/barcelona?lang=de
```

This is useful for venues with multilingual visitors. Create separate QR codes for each language:

| Audience | Deep Link |
|----------|-----------|
| German visitors | `/tour/museum?lang=de` |
| Spanish visitors | `/tour/museum?lang=es` |
| English visitors | `/tour/museum?lang=en` |

The language parameter:
- Takes priority over browser language detection
- Is saved to the visitor's preferences for the session
- Works on both tour and stop URLs (`/tour/museum/3?lang=de`)
- Is case-insensitive (`?lang=DE` works the same as `?lang=de`)

<Note>
Invalid language codes are ignored and the app falls back to browser detection or the default language.
</Note>

## Example: Multiple entry points

A museum with QR codes at each section:

| Location | Deep Link |
|----------|-----------|
| Main entrance | `/tour/museum` |
| Egyptian wing | `/tour/museum/3` |
| Gift shop | `/tour/museum/8` |

## Tracking with UTM parameters

Add tracking parameters without breaking the deep link:

```
https://yoursite.com/tour/barcelona/3?utm_source=signage&utm_medium=qr
```

AudioGuideKit ignores unknown query parameters, so UTM codes won't affect functionality.

## Invalid links

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Invalid stop ID | Loads tour overview normally |
| Malformed URL | Redirects to default tour |

<Tip>
Test your deep links after content changes. A changed stop ID will break existing QR codes.
</Tip>

## Offline behavior

Deep links work offline after the tour is downloaded. If a visitor is offline and hasn't downloaded the tour, the tour will fail to load.
