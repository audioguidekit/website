---

AudioGuideKit is a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities. Visitors can download tours for areas with poor connectivity—underground metro stations, remote trails, or historic buildings with thick walls.

## Offline modes

Configure offline behavior in `metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "barcelona",
  "offlineMode": "optional"
}
```

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `optional` | Download button shown, streaming also works | Most tours |
| `online-only` | No download button, streams only | Frequently updated content |
| `offline-only` | Must download before starting | Remote locations with no connectivity |

### Optional (default)

- "Download for Offline" button appears below "Start Tour"
- Visitors choose to download or stream
- Best for most use cases

### Online only

- No download button
- Tour streams directly from network
- Use when you don't want stale cached versions

### Offline only

- "Download Tour" is the primary action
- Tour won't start until download completes
- Use for locations with no internet

## What gets downloaded

| Content | Typical Size |
|---------|--------------|
| Tour data | ~10 KB |
| Images | ~1-2 MB |
| Audio files | ~50-200 MB |

<Warning>
Audio is the biggest download. A 45-minute tour can be 100MB+. Set expectations in your tour description.
</Warning>

## iOS notes

For the best offline experience on iOS, recommend visitors add the app to their home screen:

1. Tap Share button in Safari
2. Select "Add to Home Screen"
3. Open from the home screen icon

<Note>
Safari may clear PWA storage when the device is low on space. Home screen apps have better persistence.
</Note>

## Updating content

When you update tour content and deploy:

- Tour data (JSON) updates automatically when visitors are online
- Audio files stay cached until visitors re-download

For audio updates, either change filenames (e.g., `01-welcome-v2.mp3`) or ask visitors to re-download the tour.
