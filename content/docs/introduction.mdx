AudioGuideKit is a ready-to-deploy audio tour player that runs in any web browser. Museums, cities, historical sites, nature trails—if you've got stories to tell and audio to play, AudioGuideKit has you covered.

<Note>
AudioGuideKit is open source and free to use. You host it yourself, which means no monthly fees and complete control over your data.

## Why AudioGuideKit?

Let's be honest: building a good audio tour app from scratch is surprisingly hard. You need smooth audio playback (that doesn't crash on iOS Safari), offline support so visitors don't lose signal mid-tour, multi-language switching, progress tracking, and a mobile-first design that doesn't make people squint.

AudioGuideKit handles all of that out of the box. You just add your content.

## Who is this for?

AudioGuideKit is designed for people who want to create professional audio tours without building an app from scratch:

- **Museums and galleries** looking for a self-hosted alternative to expensive tour guide apps
- **Cities and tourism boards** wanting to offer free walking tours
- **Historical sites** that need offline-capable guides for remote locations
- **Tour operators** who want a branded mobile experience
- **Developers** who need a solid foundation to customize

<Tip>
You don't need to be a programmer to use AudioGuideKit. If you can edit a JSON file (which is just structured text), you can create tours. We'll show you exactly how.
</Tip>

## How it works

AudioGuideKit is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React. You:

1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies
2. **Add your tour content** as JSON files
3. **Deploy** to any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

Visitors open your URL in their browser—no app store, no downloads, no friction.
