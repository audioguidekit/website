# Theming

AudioGuideKit's theming system gives you complete control over the visual appearance. Change colors, fonts, and styling to match your brand or create a unique experience.

## Built-in themes

AudioGuideKit comes with two carefully designed themes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Default Light" icon="sun">
    Clean, distraction-free light aesthetic with high legibility and soft gray accents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Default Dark" icon="moon">
    Refined dark aesthetic with grayscale palette and sans-serif typography.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using a theme

Set the theme in your `metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "barcelona",
  "themeId": "default-light"
}
```

Or `"default-dark"` for the dark theme.

That's it! The entire app adopts the theme—cards, buttons, player, sheets, everything.

## What you can customize

Themes control virtually every visual aspect:

| Area | What You Control |
|------|------------------|
| **Colors** | Backgrounds, text, borders, accents |
| **Typography** | Font families, sizes, weights |
| **Cards** | Background, borders, shadows, corner radius |
| **Buttons** | Primary, secondary, and download button styles |
| **Mini Player** | Progress bar, controls, transcription text |
| **Bottom Sheets** | Background, handle color, title styling |
| **Step Indicators** | Active, inactive, and completed states |
| **Branding** | Custom logo on start screen |

<Note>
You can tweak individual properties or create an entirely new theme from scratch. It's up to you how far you want to go.
</Note>

## Theme structure

Themes are TypeScript objects with a specific structure. Here's a simplified view:

```typescript
const myTheme = {
  id: 'my-theme',
  name: 'My Theme',

  header: { /* colors, progress bar */ },
  mainContent: { /* background */ },
  cards: { /* colors, typography, shadows */ },
  buttons: { /* primary, secondary styles */ },
  miniPlayer: { /* player controls, progress */ },
  sheets: { /* bottom sheet styles */ },
  typography: { /* font families */ },
  colors: { /* semantic color palette */ },
  // ...and more
};
```

Each section controls a specific part of the UI. We'll cover all of them in [Theme Reference](/docs/themes/reference).

## Quick customization

Want to just change the accent color? You don't need a full custom theme.

The easiest approach is to copy an existing theme and modify it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy a theme file">
    ```bash
    cp src/theme/themes/default-light.ts src/theme/themes/my-brand.ts
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change the accent color">
    Find all instances of the primary color (like `#6366F1`) and replace with your brand color.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register the theme">
    Add to `src/theme/themes/index.ts`:
    ```typescript
    import { myBrandTheme } from './my-brand';

    export const themes = {
      'default-light': defaultLightTheme,
      'default-dark': defaultDarkTheme,
      'my-brand': myBrandTheme,
    };
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use it">
    Set `"themeId": "my-brand"` in your `metadata.json`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Per-language themes

You can use different themes for different languages by overriding in the language file:

```json
// es.json
{
  "id": "barcelona",
  "language": "es",
  "themeId": "warm-theme"
}
```

Spanish visitors would see `warm-theme` while others see whatever's in `metadata.json`.

## Custom fonts

Themes support custom fonts from Google Fonts (or self-hosted):

```typescript
typography: {
  fontFamily: {
    sans: ['Roboto', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
    heading: ['Playfair Display', 'serif'],
    numbers: ['JetBrains Mono', 'monospace'],
  },
}
```

Remember to add the font to `index.html`:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Branding: Custom logo

Display your logo on the tour start screen:

```typescript
branding: {
  logoUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/logo.svg',
  showLogoBorder: true,
  logoSize: 'fit',  // or 'original'
}
```

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `showLogoBorder: true` | Logo in a rounded rectangle with shadow |
| `showLogoBorder: false` | Logo displayed directly, no container |
| `logoSize: 'fit'` | Constrained to 48x48px |
| `logoSize: 'original'` | Natural image dimensions |

## What you can't customize

Some things are intentionally fixed:

- **Component layout** - Where elements are positioned
- **Animation types** - Transitions use spring physics
- **Icon shapes** - Only colors are themeable
- **Spacing between elements** - Some spacing is hardcoded

These constraints ensure the app remains usable and visually consistent regardless of theme choices.
