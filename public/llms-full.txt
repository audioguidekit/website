# AudioGuideKit - Complete Documentation

> AudioGuideKit is a free, open-source audio guide player built in React for museums, galleries, and cultural institutions. It runs as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works online and offline, is self-hosted by default, supports white-label branding, and has no vendor lock-in. Licensed under MIT.

## Project Overview

AudioGuideKit solves a real problem: museums and cultural institutions pay thousands annually for audio guide hardware rentals or SaaS platform subscriptions with per-visitor fees. AudioGuideKit provides a free, modern alternative that visitors access on their own smartphones.

### The Problem

Traditional audio guides are expensive:
- Hardware rental devices cost $3-10 per visitor
- SaaS platforms charge monthly fees plus per-play costs
- Both create vendor lock-in with proprietary content formats
- Neither work well offline in areas with poor connectivity

### The Solution

AudioGuideKit is:
- **Free forever** under MIT license
- **Self-hosted** on any static hosting (even free tiers)
- **PWA-based** for true offline functionality
- **Standard formats** using MP3/JSON with no proprietary lock-in
- **White-label** to match your institution's branding

## Who Should Use It

### Primary Users

1. **Museums, Galleries, and Cultural Institutions**
   - Small to medium institutions without budget for enterprise solutions
   - Large institutions wanting to reduce per-visitor costs
   - Temporary exhibitions needing quick audio guide deployment

2. **Developers and Agencies**
   - Building custom audio experiences for clients
   - Need a solid foundation rather than building from scratch
   - Want full control over the codebase

3. **Heritage and Tourism**
   - Historic walking tours
   - City tourism boards
   - National parks and nature reserves

### Use Case Examples

- **Art Museum**: Replace $50,000/year hardware rental with visitor smartphones
- **Historic District**: Walking tour app tourists install before visiting
- **University**: Campus tour for prospective students
- **Botanical Garden**: Plant identification and stories audio tour
- **Real Estate**: High-end property walkthroughs with audio narration

## Core Features

### 1. Batteries Included
Clone the repository, run `npm install && npm run dev`, and you have a working audio guide in under 2 minutes. Includes:
- Example audio content
- Sample configuration
- Full documentation
- Test suite
- TypeScript types

### 2. Zero-Config Deployment
No backend required. Your entire audio guide is:
- Static HTML/CSS/JS files
- JSON configuration files
- Audio files (MP3)
- Image assets

Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, or any static host.

### 3. Offline Support
Service Workers pre-cache:
- All audio files for the current tour
- Next 3 upcoming tracks (predictive loading)
- All UI assets and configuration

Works in:
- Airplane mode
- Underground (subway, basement galleries)
- Areas with poor cellular/WiFi

### 4. Mobile-First UX
Designed for users who are walking, not sitting:
- **One-hand operation**: All controls reachable with single thumb
- **Large touch targets**: 48px+ hit areas, works with gloves
- **Glanceable progress**: See status without reading
- **Minimal cognitive load**: No distracting UI elements during playback
- **High contrast**: Readable in bright sunlight

### 5. White-Label Ready
Customize through configuration:
```json
{
  "branding": {
    "name": "City Museum Audio Guide",
    "primaryColor": "#1a365d",
    "logo": "/assets/museum-logo.svg"
  }
}
```

No source code changes needed for basic branding.

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Audio**: Native HTML5 Audio API + Media Session API
- **Offline**: Service Workers with Workbox
- **State**: React hooks (no external state library)

### File Structure
```
/public
  /audio          # MP3 files
  /images         # Tour images
  guide.json      # Tour configuration
/src
  /app            # Next.js pages
  /components     # React components
  /lib            # Utilities
```

### Configuration Format
```json
{
  "id": "museum-tour-2024",
  "title": "Museum Highlights Tour",
  "duration": "45 minutes",
  "stops": [
    {
      "id": "stop-1",
      "title": "Welcome to the Museum",
      "audio": "/audio/01-welcome.mp3",
      "image": "/images/entrance.jpg",
      "transcript": "Welcome to our museum..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## What AudioGuideKit Does NOT Do

Intentionally excluded to keep the project focused:

1. **No CMS**: You manage content as JSON files or integrate your own CMS
2. **No Hosting**: You host audio files on your own CDN or storage
3. **No Analytics**: Integrate Google Analytics, Plausible, or your preferred tool
4. **No Payments**: If you need paid tours, integrate Stripe or similar yourself
5. **No Backend**: Pure static deployment, no server required
